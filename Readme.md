## Fixes the JSDOC in treesitter parser

Go to the folder with the data of nvim and enter `nvim-treesitter/queries/ecma/indents.scm`

At the end of the file change the following line to:
```scm
  [
    (comment) @auto 
    (template_string)
  ] @ignore
```

Now the problem will be temporally fixed

## Fixes The use of todo-comments

Install ripgrep

And then you can use:
```
TODO: To mark todos
HACK: To mark something a little bit strange
PERF: To mark the fully optimised code
NOTE: To mark some notes
FIX: To mark code that needs fixing
WARN: We don't know, you don't know
```

To see the list of comments of this type use the following command:
`<space>td`
